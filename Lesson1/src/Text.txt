TypeScript is a strongly types prograaming language which is built on top of javascript or we can say
typescript is javascript with syntax for types 
Strongly typed languages demand the specification of datatypes 
typescript is a statically typed language which means types are checked at compile time 
where as jvascript is dynamically typed language which means types are checked at run time 

It is created by microsoft 

in order to compile a javascript file from a typescript file we need to write 
tsc fileName.ts in the terminal 

Now any change we do in our ts file we need to compile it again in order to see the changes or we could 
do 
tsc fileName.ts -w
-w watch for changes 

Now the file structure in ts looks 
a build folder in which we put our compiled code like html css js 
while our raw code like ts will be in src folder 
to let typescript know that all of our typescript code in the src directory and then compile them and 
put them in the build directory or inside a js folder in the built directory 

we can do this using typescript config file 
tsc --init
now go in there change the rootDir to src where our ts files will be, 
then change the outDir to where will be your js files 
build/js
in order to look for all the files the directory we can write 
tsc -w in the lesson1
note that while watching in case if decided to delete our .ts file it will not automatically delete 
the its .js file 

Now we have decided a directory where all our ts file are going to be 
so in case if any ts file is outside those directory we can make ts ignore them 
using
add   "include": ["src"] add this at the very end 
by allowing noemitonerror property we make sure that in case if there is an error in our typescript
file, it wont compile our js file
